            <p>Master modern web technologies and collaborate with a team to design and develop a winning capstone project against other groups.</p>
            <p>• Learning full-stack technologies: Git/GitHub, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, MongoDB, and FastAPI
            <br> • Participating in professional development sessions for LinkedIn, resumes, and interview skills
            <br> • Collaborating with mentoring group on competitive final project</p>

            <h4>Legislator.AI (Currently Working On)</h4> 
            <p>Policymakers lack tools to draft and refine legislation efficiently, leading to slow, error-prone processes.</p>
            <p>I am building an AI co-pilot to generate new bills from scratch and improve existing ones with evidence-based recommendations.</p>
            <p> • Assembling a massive legal corpus by scraping government APIs and websites.
            <br> • Training a specialized AI model on this data to master legal drafting and analysis.
            <br> • Engineering a dual-function system that both generates bills and critiques drafts for weaknesses.</p>
            <p>Creating an AI that accelerates the entire legislative process—from initial draft creation to final refinement—to help policymakers save time and build more effective laws.</p>

        <div class = "experience">
            <h4>Gambling Project</h4>
            <p>Wanted to design a scalable Java project to demonstrate object-oriented programming through probability-based games.</p>
            <p>Create a modular system where multiple games share common balance and randomization logic.</p>
            <p>Developed a core Game class to handle player currency and random events, then extended it with subclasses for different games using inheritance and polymorphism.</p>
            <p>Produced a reusable, maintainable framework that cleanly supports adding new probability-driven games.</p>
